## In June, a news story showed that ABC was delaying a story because of political factors.

[NEWS LINK](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jun/11/abc-to-air-delayed-four-corners-episode-about-scott-morrison-and-a-supporter-of-qanon)

The news involves the protagonist, is the current Prime Minister of Australia,[Scott Morrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison).

News that the reported by Louise Milligan had been delayed caused a political furore last week.

Just because, the subject of the story is the Prime Minister of Canada.

> After refusing to answer Four Corners’ questions, Morrison said at a press conference on Friday it was [“deeply offensive” and “poor form” ](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jun/04/abc-boss-says-he-had-concerns-about-four-corners-scott-morrison-qanon-program)of the program to investigate his relationship with Stewart.

We have to wonder if ABC News received pressure from the government, or from the Prime Minister himself, to make changes to the news that led to the delay.

> The ABC managing director, David Anderson, denied he had “pulled” the program, saying he had asked Four Corners to answer some “queries and concerns” he had.

abc attempted to clear the air, but still did not explain why the show did not air.So we have to question again, the impartiality of the ABC, the already so-called neutrality, I even think it, not at all.
