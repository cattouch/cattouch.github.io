# ABC headquarters had been raided by AFP



In June 2019, Australian Federal Police raided the ABC newsroom in Ultimo.

## Event

Three AFP officers entered the building and were met by ABC security and staff in the lobby before meeting with the broadcaster’s lawyers in a raid that is connected to a 2017 report based on leaked defence documents called The Afghan files.

Executive Editor ABC News & ABC Head of Investigative Journalism **John Lyons** live [tweeted](https://twitter.com/TheLyonsDen) the raid as it happened, including the morning tea order for the AFP team (15 sandwiches and 12 flat whites) and some of the radio/tv questions being asked by the police officers:

> “What’s a Tardis?” one AFP officer said when he saw the word. “It’s like an editing suite,” someone replied.

 This raid comes a day after the home of **News Corp** journalist, **Annika Smethurst**, was raided in connection with a 2018 story concerning top secret plans to expand the surveillance of Australian citizens.



## Reflections

This raid, whether it contains political implications, I think it does.

Prior to this, the Australian government's interference in the news was sneaky, but after this, a lot of things started to happen with impunity.

Again, it makes you think that even if abc wanted to remain neutral, the Australian government, as its "boss", would not agree.



## Comments

> I think this is an infringement on the freedom of the press

> The Australian government's onslaught is a crackdown on press freedom in the name of "national security"
