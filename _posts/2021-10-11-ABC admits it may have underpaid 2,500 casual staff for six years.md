# ABC admits it may have underpaid 2,500 casual staff for six years

> The ABC has admitted it may have been underpaying about 2,500 casual staff over the past six years.

The national broadcaster announced on Thursday that it had begun a review of payments made to “flat-rate” casual staff including penalties, allowances and loadings.

It comes after the ABC admitted to underpaying a casual employee in Brisbane by $19,000 after a complaint from the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) in December.

In an email to staff on Thursday the broadcaster’s chief people officer, Rebekah Donaldson, said the wider underpayment had also been identified by the union.

Under the ABC’s enterprise bargaining agreement, employees – including casual employees – are entitled to time-and-a-half for working on public holidays, or on Saturday, or from midnight to dawn.

They are entitled to double time on Sundays, and an additional 30% pay for other kinds of work such as consistent late shifts.

In December the CPSU said it had conducted an audit of casual pay rates since August, and looked at contract terms, payslips and rosters, and found many were being underpaid.

The union’s ABC section secretary Sinddy Ealy said she believed the total unpaid wage amount would be “substantial” at a time “when the ABC can ill afford it”.

ABC is proving to be an untrustworthy news organization by doing all sorts of things.
