# ABC apologizes for publishing fake news
ABC often broadcasts unverified news, or even makes up news to broadcast

## 
In April,the ABC has issued an apology to Governor-General David Hurley and Chief of Navy Michael Noonan after being accused of “dishonest” reporting by 
implying they were in attendance for an exuberant dance performance to mark the commissioning of a naval warship.
> Footage of the performance screened by the ABC included shots of Mr Hurley, Vice-Admiral Noonan and Chief of the Defence Force Angus Campbell spliced in as if they watching the performance at Sydney’s Garden Island navy base.

> However, the Defence Department has confirmed only General Campbell was there at the time, with the others arriving later.

> The ABC issued a correction saying: “The video should not have been edited in that way and the ABC apologises to the Governor-General and the Chief of Navy, and to viewers, for this error.“

ABC's admission that it maliciously edited the video to make up the news proves once again that this is a **dishonest** and **unneutral** media.
