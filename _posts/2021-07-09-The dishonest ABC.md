# The dishonest ABC

On the ABC's Wikipedia page, there is this statement:

> A 2004 Roy Morgan media credibility survey found that journalists regarded ABC Radio as the most accurate news source in the country and the ABC as the second "most politically biased media organisation in Australia".


Wikipedia cites this [report](https://web.archive.org/web/20090914061917/http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20040903.pdf), and on page 4 we can see the conclusion that:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Which is the most politically 
        partisan media organisation in 
        Australia?</td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td>News Ltd </td>
        <td>40% </td>
    <tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The ABC </td>
        <td>25% </td>
    <tr> 
    <tr>
        <td>etc. </td>
        <td>etc. </td>
    <tr> 
</table>

The ABC is not neutral at all, nor can it remain neutral without political leanings, why?

Let's take another point:

> It is principally funded by the direct grants from the Australian Government, and is administered by a board appointed by the government of the day. 

**Government-funded and government-appointed agency management, I don't believe at all that he can maintain his independence very well.**
