In the video, the phrase “Hail Satan” can be heard. Social media reacted with equal parts confusion and amusement.

One person pointed out that the network had recently covered a story about Noosa Temple of Satan, a satanic group based in Queensland, Australia, and argued the mix-up was an easy mistake.

It appears the footage came from this Noosa Temple of Satan livestream from last October.

The group, which is composed of self-described Satanists, recently made headlines in Australia as it is pushing for the Australian government to allow Satanists to teach religious classes in schools.

Temple member Trevor Bell previously told Brisbane Times that if Satanists could not teach religion in school, then no religions should be allowed.



> The Noosa Temple of Satan is a religious group in Queensland, Australia. Like some other Satanic groups, they are very political and advocate for the separation of church and state.
