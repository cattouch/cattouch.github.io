# Racial Discrimination

Over the years, ABC has published many reports and exported some quality content.
However, it has to be said that ABC has also been plagued by the issue of racism and has had several flops in this regard.

## Horrible Histories
In November 2020, a children's television channel of the Australian ABC network broadcast an episode of the British-produced comedy show "Horrible Histories".<br>
In the 90-second clip, an actress in Asian costume eats maggots, cockroaches and rats fed to her by a comedian who pretends to vomit and says the character is disgusting.<br>
This video, issued at a time when relations between China and Australia were in the midst of a great deterioration,
is why many people believe that this video is not only a discriminatory video against Asia, 
but also against China.

### Refuse to apologize
Shortly after the release of this video, APAC news published a news article :[ABC doubles down after racist clip](https://apac.news/abc-doubles-down-after-racist-clip/).
> Rather than apologize for a children‚Äôs comedy show depicting Chinese people eating rats, 
> cockroaches and maggots, the national broadcaster says it was ‚Äúexplaining the eating culture‚Äù of ancient China

Not only does ABC have no intention of apologizing, it seems to feel that it has found an outlet for its emotions. Racism, for them, is probably not a big deal either.

## To be updated
ABC won't stop being racist, and I won't stop updating.
